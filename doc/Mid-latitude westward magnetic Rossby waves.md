## Mid-latitude westward magnetic Rossby waves

### Braginsky 1998 formulation

##### Definitions

$\beta : m^{-1}s^{-1}$

$k_\tau^2 = k_\phi^2+k_\theta^2\propto m^2+l^2$

$\omega_\beta \propto \beta m H^2 (N/\Omega)^2$ (eq. 35a)

$ \omega_B^2 \propto k_\tau B^2 (N/\Omega)^2$ (eq. 35b)

##### Wave Dispersion equation 

$\omega_{MR} \propto - C_1\beta m H^2 (N/\Omega)^2 -C_2k_\tau^2 B^2(N/\Omega)^2/(\beta m H^2 (N/\Omega)^2)$ (eq. 39a)

then, simplify: 

$\omega_{MR} \propto - C_1 \beta m H^2 (N/\Omega)^2 -C_2 k_\tau^2 B^2/(\beta m H^2)$

##### Comparison Notes

* for H=20 km , N = 10
  * weak B dependence
    * log(period) ~ -0.5*log(B)
    * period ~ 1/B^0.5 ? 
    * **f ~ B^0.5**
* for N=1
  * strong H dependence
    * log(period) ~ log(1/H)
    * **f ~ H** 
* for H=20
  * N>1 = **f ~ N**
  * N<1 = f == constant

##### Wave Periods

Braginsky states that his waves should have a period of ~30 years for H=80km, N=2 Omega, B = 5G, for m=1,2. I find that for m=6, N=1, H=80km, B ~ 5G, I obtain periods on the order of 10 years for l=0. As his frequency is roughly proportional to m, this might indicate that m=1,2 may have 3-6x lower frequencies, which means 3-6x larger periods (30-60 years). This matches Braginsky's results very well. 

He also states that for m ~5 and the same layer parameters as above, his waves have periods on the order of 3 years. This is roughly consistent with my result of ~10 years. Also, tweaking either H or N from the layer parameters stated in my model easily moves my wave periods to 3 years. 

##### Conclusions from comparison:

My westward-propagating mid-latitdue waves don't seem to have the same dependence on H, N or B as Braginsky's waves. 

For Braginsky, f ~ H^2 and f ~ N^2 (assuming C_2 is small). However, for my results, I see f ~ H and f ~ N

On the other hand, stated wave periods seem to match quite well for the parameters given. However, it could be that is just because Braginsky + me only investigate waves with periods between a few years and a few decades, as they're the only ones that are of geomagnetic interest.
